# K-Means-clustering
clustering algorithm helps to discover groups of objects where the average distances between the members of each cluster are closer than to members in other clusters.

Clustering is used to find structure in unlabeled data. Itâ€™s the most common form of unsupervised learning.

Several Algorithms have been proposed for clustering. However, when compared to other clustering algorithms the K-means algorithm is more effective. This is because K-means allows us to pre-cluster the database which in turn produces good results.

Additionally, K-means clustering is the simplest to implement and to run. All we need to do is choose the number of clusters(K) and run it number of times.
 K Means Algorithm:-
K-means clustering is the process of partitioning a set of data objects into subsets. Each subset is a cluster such that the similarity within the cluster is greater and the similarity between the other clusters is less.

K-means algorithm iteratively performs this two steps:

1.The first step assigns clusters to points by assigning them to the cluster with nearest centriod.
2.The second step calculates the new mean from the points belonging to the cluster.
We repeat these two steps till convergence.




Dataset handmade
generated the data programmatically by following Random / Gaussian distribution. The dataset includes 3000 instances where each instance is made up of 2 features.
